/**
 * Find the on-disk path of a task file by ID, supporting cross-org lookup.
 *
 * cortextOS's standard dispatch pattern is an orchestrator in one org
 * filing tasks that get assigned to specialists in other orgs. Before
 * this helper existed, updateTask
 * and completeTask hardcoded `join(paths.taskDir, taskId + '.json')` — which
 * points at the CURRENT agent's org tasks dir — so the specialist could not
 * drive the lifecycle of any task that was filed from a sibling org. Every
 * cross-org assignment required a manual workaround dance where the filer
 * ran update/complete on behalf of the assignee.
 *
 * This helper fixes that by using a two-tier lookup:
 *
 *   1. Fast path: check the caller's OWN org tasks dir first. Most tasks
 *      live there and this check pays zero scan cost when it hits.
 *   2. Fallback: scan every sibling org under `<ctxRoot>/orgs/*` for a
 *      matching task file. Only runs when the fast path missed, so
 *      same-org operations take no perf hit.
 *
 * Task IDs are generated as `task_<epoch_ms>_<3digit_random>` so real
 * collisions are effectively impossible — but if the scan ever finds the
 * same ID in multiple orgs (e.g. due to a bug in ID generation or a manual
 * file copy), we warn loudly naming the task ID, the match count, AND the
 * org names so an operator can investigate without having to grep the IDs
 * themselves. We still return the first match and keep operations flowing;
 * erroring on a theoretical collision would be worse UX than the warn.
 *
 * Exported because the helper is a useful primitive for any future caller
 * that needs cross-org task lookup (e.g. a hypothetical `get-task` command,
 * task-graph visualization, or cross-org list-tasks flag).
